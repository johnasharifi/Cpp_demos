# Cpp_demos

Cpp_demos.cpp is main entry point for the program. 

It shows some basic object-oriented behavior in C++ using models of a Circle (Circle.h).
Then we move on to an implementation and use case for a recursive templated BinaryTree (BinaryTree.h) class. 
Additional arrays are created with good memory management practices in mind.
